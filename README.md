# Midi Spacer

Space notes of an inconsistent tempo to conform to gridlines. The user manually inserts "checkpoints", and the program spaces the input notes such that each checkpoint is a constant distance apart.

## How to run

Make sure the module `mido` is installed. Then:

    python3 ui.py

To hear output a virtual MIDI piano is reqiured such as VMPK or Garageband.
